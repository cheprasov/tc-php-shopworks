Please see class `\App\Service\ManningCalculator\ManningCalculator`

> Make sure that all the above scenarios are proven to work.
> We would like for you to describe another scenario, involving at least three people and implement it too.
If you think of one more scenario and/or implement it, that would be a plus.

Done. Please see `\Tests\Feature\Service\ManningCalculator\ManningCalculatorTest`
